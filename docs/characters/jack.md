## Brief Overview

### Type of Character
Jack is a boxer style character with charge moves, similar to Balrog in the Street Fighter Series. He has command grabs (both a 360 and a super).

### Recommended Decks

- Infinity: 
   - Having more meter means leads to higher damage combos
   - Guard Cancel complements his defense as he doesn't have a good reversal (is this true?)
   - Guard Cancel -> Raging Buffalo is really strong

- Aggro:
   - 少しクセがあるがジャックの持つ火力を更に高める事が出来る。ランページ30の状態からのループコンボはラウンドの決定打になるほどの火力になる。(help translating)

## Strengths
- Seen as one of the best characters in the game
- Hits really hard, does a lot of damage. Highest practical damage in the game.
- Has a nice Anti-Air (2HP)
- Great pokes

## Weaknesses
- Very execution intensive character
- May require you to learn character specific combos
