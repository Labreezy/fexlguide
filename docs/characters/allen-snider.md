## Brief Overview
### Type of Character
Allen is a shotokan style character with a bit of a twist. His solid fireball and Dragon Punch (well, Rising Dragon) and generally good normals are supplemented with relatively easy and damaging loops using his Triple Break super to launch the opponent over and over as long as he has the meter. His command grab and Justice Fist, a super cancellable and high damaging move that's otherwise negative on hit(!) rounds him out and in general is a incredibly solid and accessible character. 

#### Strengths
- His projectile (Soul Force, 236P) and dragon punch (Rising Dragon, 623P) allows  for solid "Super Turbo" style play
- Decent chip options with both Soul Force and Fire Force without having to use Gougi such as Berserker
- Can consistently turn confirms into high damage with Triple Break loops, allowing him to easily cash out damage from his meter.
- Has both a dragon punch and his 5HK for anti airing
- Decent normals in general
- His fireball game allows him to generate meter in the neutral very well.

#### Weaknesses
- Somewhat low damage without meter
- Has a few underwhelming normals (mainly his heavy punches)
- Many of his damaging options are unsafe and often fully punishable if they don't hit or are blocked.



### Recommended Decks
- **Infinity:**
    - Allen really wants meter for his damage, which Infinity provides almost immediately with its 3 Meter Ups
    - Guard Cancel is generally solid anyway, but Allen has both a strong combo starter with Justice Fist and a reversal with Rising Dragon to punish people's blockstrings and pressure
    - Rage is a very nice bonus, allowing Allen to consistently get full Triple Break Loops in the later rounds.

    <th>C.blo</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>6MK</b></td>

<tr>
    <td><b>MP+MK (Hard Attack)</b></td>
    <td>Allen's universal overhead, should mainly be used to catch people trying to block Allen's many good lows and should be always be super cancelled as it is actually - on hit! Still, fairly decent to throw out once in a while. While Allen jumps, its speed and actual hurtbox makes it pretty poor for getting over low normals.</td>

### Specials

    <th>Startup</th>
    <th>S.blo</th>
    <th>C.blo</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Soul Force (236P)</b></td>
    <td>A regular fireball that travels the length of the screen, the strength of the punch controls the speed of the fireball. 

Super cancels which allows for confirms into Fire Force or even start a Triple Break loop. 

Generally safe at long ranges but be wary of using it in blockstrings, as upclose it is outright punishable on block. Soul Force has decent pushback midscreen but will not pushback in the corner. </td>
    <td>13/-14/-11</td>
    <td>13/-14/-11</td>
    <td>13/-14/-11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Rising Dragon (623P)</b></td>
    <td>A rising uppercut that is invulnerable on startup, making it an excellent anti-air and reversal. Massively unsafe on block however with each strength getting progressively worse.

The strength of the button determines the height and number of hits of Rising Dragon.

Super cancels, Fire force making it less unsafe and Triple Break potentially starting a loop on hit but will be just as unsafe on block.  </td>
    <td>5/-18/-16</td>
    <td>5/-31/-29</td>
    <td>5/-35/-33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Justice Fist (421P)</b></td>
    <td>An advanced outstretching lunge which deals great damage but is unsafe on hit, never mind on block. 

Very importantly, it super cancels which makes it excellent as combo filler for Triple Break loops.

The strength of the button determines the length Allen travels.

While it does destroy fireballs, it should only be used in combos since it's way too dangerous to  miss. Fantastic combo filler, don't use it to end combos if you can help it, especially in the corner.</td>
    <td>15/-79/-75</td>
    <td>15/-83/-79</td>
    <td>15/-87/-83</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Vaulting Kick (63214K)</b></td>
    <td>An command grab that knocks the opponent to the opposite side of the screen. No difference in button versions.

Does slightly more damage than normal grab, but is mainly useful for being untechable.</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Grab</td>
    <td>Grab</td>
</tr>

### Supers
Quick note, in startup framedata (eg. x + y), x means the startup until Super Freeze and Y is the startup for the super to come out afterwards.
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Super</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Startup</th>
    <th>S.blo</th>
    <th>C.blo</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Fire Force (236236P)</b></td>
    <td>A super version of Soul Force with 5 hits., deals somewhat low damage but is a much safer cancel than Triple Break and can even cancel into Triple Break. Decent chip option as well. Fairly fast, can potentially be used to beat out other projectiles in a fireball war. Similarly to Soul Force, it becomes much more unsafe in the corner as it relies on pushback to keep you safe. </td>
    <td>4 + 4</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Triple Break (236236K)</b></td>
    <td>A triple kick which send the opponent flying up into the air. Low damage but makes it incredibly easy to get juggle combos which can lead into Triple Break again. 

It's not difficult to learn practical combos that can lead to using all 3 bars of super on Triple Break. The speed and hitbox of Triple Break also allows for some cheeky conversions, making Allen incredibly explosive.

A sample beginner combo may be 2LK 2MK 6MK Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon. </td>
    <td>6 + 9</td>

## Gameplan
### Neutral

Allen has a selection of decent pokes, with his 5 LK, 5MK, 2MP and 2MK being the most useful. These buttons also can easily combo into 2HK or even 6MK into Triple Break or Fire Force, allowing him to cash out damage from his far reaching normals. 2HK by itself is great for its knockdown but is very bad to whiff given its long recovery.

Allen also has a very solid fireball game allowing him to chip the opponent out and zone them. If they attempt to get around it with jumping, his Rising Dragon and 5HK allow him to knock the opponent out of the sky. His LP soul force in particular allows him to both control space and even let him run in very safely.

Allen's fast walk speed and run speed allows him to quickly get ground on the opponent and lets him get his pokes into range.

### Offense
### Mix-Ups

Allen doesn't have overhead normals or specials apart from MP+MK, so Allen relies on frame traps and tick throws along with his command grab to open a turtling opponent. His solid crossup kick also lets him get some left-right mixup on opponents recovering from a knockdown. Allen's solid chip options also means that it is no big loss for his strings to be blocked.

### Set-Ups

##### Vaulting Kick into Fire Force

Simple chip option from fullscreen, sadly you don't get time for much of a runup before the opponent recovers.

### Frame-Traps

#### 2MK/2MP > 5HP

### Defense

Outside of the usual defense options, Allen does have Rising Dragon to potentially worm his way out of gaps in the opponent's pressure

### Reversals
### Escapes

## Character Specific Techniques
## Combos
### BNB’s
### Hit-Confirms
### Anti-Air Conversions

#### 5HK Triple Break

This allows Allen to potentially deal 50%+ off antiairs using a Triple Break Loop. Annoyingly, this can easily drop off max range 5HK connects, making it pretty risky to confirm.

#### 5HK Fire Force

A less rewarding but much less unsafe super cancel. Depending on how you hit it, may just deal 1 hit or get the full 5 hits. If you have the spare meter, this is a pretty safe way of squeezing out extra damage.
