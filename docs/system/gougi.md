title: Gougi
summary: Brief overview of how Gougis works

### What Are Gougi?

Gougi is the most recognizable unique mechanic for Fighting Ex Layer. When you pick your character, you also choose a deck of Gougi. Gougi is a set of 5 powerups that activate when certain conditions are met and give passive or active effects for the rest of the match (not just the round, the whole match!)

### How does Gougi work?

For the sake of example, let's take a look at Aggro:

***BIG OLD AGGRO DECK IMAGE HERE***

The Trigger is the condition you need to fill for the Gougi's Effect to activate. So, with Grab Up, once you land 2 non-command throws, you get a nice 20% increase to your grab range for the rest of the match. Erase Blow also has a simple Trigger with a simple but useful effect. 

You'll notice these less impactful Gougi are in blue, blue signifying that they are easy to get but not massively powerful.

Yellow Gougi on the other hand are much more difficult to Trigger, often requiring more than one round to Trigger. They make up for this with extremely powerful effects that are often the centerpiece of the deck. Illusion requires taking 300 damage (For reference, characters have 200 health, meaning this will always take at least one round to Trigger.) but give you an automatic free escape from 1 highly damaging combo per round. 

Rampage is what makes Aggro the Aggro deck as its Effect increases your damage as you hit the opponent up to a max of 30 stacks (1% damage increase per stack???) while having a fairly reasonable Trigger to activate early in the match.

Essentially, Blue Gougi are nice bonuses while Yellow Gougi are the powerful effects that you build up to in a match. These will also affect your character's playstyle, allowing them to play up their strengths or cover their weaknesses. Allen Snider loves Infinity as he wants meter, is good at building it up and constantly being topped up with the Rage Effect allows him to consistently do full Triple Break Loops to finish off matches. A Darun Mister on the other hand can take Thunderbolt, allowing him to use the Teleport Gougi to warp on top of the opponent, negating his poor mobility.

### What should I base my Gougi Deck choices on?

While there will be "best" Decks for characters, if you want to mess around with the Decks, first consider what the character wants to do. Grab Master probably won't get much mileage on Kairi and his lack of command grabs for example. Doctrine Dark has excellent mixup but not an amazing approach so Shinobi with its Ghost Gougi covers his weakness and allows his strength to excel.

Also, do you want to enjoy the effects of your Gougi as soon as possible or are you okay being relatively weaker than your opponent for the beginning of the match? Some Decks require completely changing the way you play to Trigger the Gougi such as Miracle or Super Nova. Shinobi has very good effects especially considering how easy the Triggers are, but compared to a fully activated Juggernaut is arguably less powerful.

Most characters thankfully have more than one optimal deck in any case, so you'll still be able to mess around and not hamper yourself. See the character pages for recommendations.

    <td>Super Armour means that your character doesn't recoil from most hits. You will still take damage, but you will be able to fully act. This means your character can get full punishes on BEING hit by an opponent, walk through projectiles and consistently win trades. However, being knocked down, juggled or launched will still work as normal against Super Armour. Damage that is Super Armour'd through will be unscaled, so notably multihit moves and supers will actually do more damage than normal (For example, Allen Snider's Fire Force.) </td>
